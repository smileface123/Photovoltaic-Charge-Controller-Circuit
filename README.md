Never built or tested, sadly no voltage hysteresys, based on discrete elements to prevent software failure, not programmed yet, 

Postponed because of complexity and personal time constraints.

FYI, e.g. TI or Maxim offers more functional ICs for similiar tasks in a single IC.


Though be helpful for Freifunk or Pirate Box.
